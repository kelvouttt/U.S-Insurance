# U.S Medical Insurance Cost

This is the portfolio project from Codecademy to analyze the medical insurance record in the U.S region. This analysis only provides some basic functions and insights that was created originally by me. The goal of this project is to analyze some factors that contribute to the difference in the insurance cost. 

# Libraries
* pandas
* NumPy

# Limitation
There are few things that limit my exploration in the data. I still have to learn about transforming a multi-dimensional list to a 1 dimension list so that I can loop through everything. In the near future, I will add more functionality to the project and I will add a class object to make the analysis more structural. Further, I will also perform data visualization on the data.
